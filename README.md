# GMM
The model considered is a mixture between a Gaussian and multinomial, with conditional independence between the categorical variables
and the quantitative variables. The expectationâ€“maximization (EM) algorithm will be used for inference of the model.
The clustering function takes as input:
- the data set
- the number of clusters
- the number of initializations of the EM algorithm (by specifying a default value)

The algorithm returns:
- the posterior probabilities for each individual belonging to each online cluster
- the partitions estimated by maximum a posteriori
- the proportions, means and variance of each cluster
- the values of the BIC and ICL criteria<br/><br/>
Data needs to contain quantitative and qualitative data or only qualitative data only,it doesn't run if only quantitative data is supplied. Use Kmeans instead for clustering with quantitative data. <br/><br/>
